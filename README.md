## How to use Redux and how to use it with React

This are simple examples I made to help my team understand redux and the connection of redux to react better.

### Folder Structure
- example:  code examples
  - justRedux - simple redux without React or any other addition
  - justReduxMultipleReducers - example for redux with multiple reducers
  - normalizr - example for redux and normalizr (no React here)
  - react-redux-provider - example of the need of using provider
  - reduxActionsLib - example using redux-actions library
  - simpleReactRedux - example combining react and redux
- react-redux: striped down functions from 'react-redux' library
- createReducer - example of syntactic sugar for switch statement reducers
- redux-lib: striped down functions from the redux lib


### TODO
- add example/ explaining about react-redux connect
- add example of file structure
- add example with webpack 2
