## How to use Redux and how to use it with React

This are simple examples I made to help my team understand redux and the connection of redux to react better.

### Folder Structure
- example:  code examples
- react-redux: striped down functions from 'react-redux' library
- createReducer - example of syntactic sugar for switch statement reducers
- redux-lib: striped down functions from the redux lib


### TODO
- add example/ explaining about react-redux connect
- add full example
- add example of file structure
- add example with webpack 2
